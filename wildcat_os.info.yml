# DEPENDENCIES
# 'Hard' dependencies are added dynamically using Wildcat's Flavor Manager. At
# least one modules will be added as a required dependency that cannot be
# uninstalled the 'wildcat' modules. That modules will add the necessary, initial
# configuration and perform other install and update tasks that are usually
# performed when the functions in the profile's .install file are called.
# Additional 'hard' dependencies, besides the 'wildcat' modules, may be added by
# specifying them as 'required' modules in 'wildcat.flavor.yml' files.

# THEMES
# The default and admin theme are dynamically set and enabled using the Flavor
# Manager. By default, 'chairman_meow' is used as the default theme and 'seven'
# as the admin theme. Another default and/or admin theme may be enabled instead,
# by using 'wildcat.flavor.yml' files.
